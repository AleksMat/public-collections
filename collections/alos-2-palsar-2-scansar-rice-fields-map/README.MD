# ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 ScanSAR Reference Rice Paddy Field Map

## Short description

  [ALOS-2 ScanSAR](https://alos-pasco.com/en/alos-2/spec/) L2.1 product contains geometrically corrected (orthorectified) 
  data in selected AOIs between 2019 and 2020 for NASA/ESA/JAXA EODashboard Hackathon.   

  The PALSAR-2 aboard the ALOS-2 is a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which emits microwave and receives the reflection 
  from the ground to acquire information. Since it does not need other sources of light such as the sun, SAR has the 
  advantage of providing satellite images during day or night. For transmitting and receiving microwaves PALSAR-2 uses 
  the L-band, which is less affected by clouds and rains. This all-weather observing capability is suitable for monitoring disasters rapidly. In addition, L-band microwave can reach to the ground partially penetrating through vegetation to obtain information about vegetation and ground surface.    

  ScanSAR is wide swath mode with 100m spatial resolution, 350km width swath, and dual polarization (HH/HV)  
  
  This collection contains reference rice paddy field  maps derived from [ALOS-2 ScanSAR](https://alos-pasco.com/en/alos-2/spec/) geometrically corrected (orthorectified) data.  
  
  The reference map is described in the digital code as 255: rice paddy field, 0: others.
