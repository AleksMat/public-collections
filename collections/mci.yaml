Name: Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI)
Description: |
  The Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) is a dimensionless indicator for critical eutrophication. It is robust and can be
  applied to any water body for the identification of potentially critical situations due to excessive algal growth.
  Originally developed for the MERIS intrument, it has been successfully transferred to other sensors as well.
  Here, we offer an MCI for the whole Sentinel-2 archive, i.e., with global coverage.
  The product contains the index itself, plus the inputs bands of Sentinel-2 as well as Scene Classification and
  Cloud Mask to allow for the analysis of potential issues caused by the contamination with undetected clouds or
  adjacency effects.
