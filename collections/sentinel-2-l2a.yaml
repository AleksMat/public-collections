Name: Sentinel-2 L2A
Description: |
  The [Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) is
  a land monitoring constellation of two satellites that provide high resolution
  optical imagery and provide continuity for the current SPOT and Landsat missions.
  The mission provides a global coverage of the Earth's land surface every 5 days,
  making the data of great use in on-going studies. L2A data  are available from September 2016 over wider Europe
  region and globally since January 2017. L2A data provide Bottom of the atmosphere (BOA) reflectance.
