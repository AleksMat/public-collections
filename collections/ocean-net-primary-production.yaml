Name: BICEP
Description: |
  The data comes from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite and uses data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite and shows the averaged methane concentrations across the globe â€” using weekly averaged maps. The methane map shown here is measured by the Tropomi instrument on the Sentinel 5 Precursor satellite.
  The Copernicus Sentinel-5P CH4 measurements were first filtered according to the recommendation in the Product Readme file (only data with a qa_value > 0.50 was used). Then the measurements are mapped on a fixed latitude-longitude grid of 4096 x 8192 pixels. The grid is turned into an EPSG:4326 geotiff file using the appropriate color scale, which is again turned into an EPSG:3857 tile map.
  Data gaps are visible based on the product quality filtering and the fact that over the sea only measurements for sun-glint situations are being provided.
