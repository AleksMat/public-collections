Name: Global Surface Water
Description: The Global Surface Water dataset was developed by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre within the framework of the Copernicus Programme. It is derived from Landsat imagery and and shows different aspects of the spatio-temporal distribution of surface water between 1984 and 2019 at the global scale.
