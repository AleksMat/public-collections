Name: Truck Detection 
Description: |
  The Truck detection algorithm detects the number of moving trucks along roads using Sentinel-2 level 2A data.  
  The author [Henrik Fisser](https://twitter.com/fisserhenrik), developed this algorithm (with the title: Truck detection – Sensing trade from space) 
  in the context of the Euro Data Cube COVID-19 edition of Sentinel Hub’s custom script contest.
  The algorithm exploits the small offset between Sentinel-2 bands which causes moving objects to appear as rainbows in RGB images allowing 
  the detection and mapping of moving trucks.  
  The output of the algorithm is locations (point geometries) and dates of detected trucks.  
  More information regarding input and output specifications can be found under additional information.
