# RelativeHum1000hPa

## Short description

This parameter is the water vapour pressure as a percentage of the value at which the air becomes saturated (the point at which water vapour begins to condense into liquid water or deposition into ice). For temperatures over 0째C (273.15 K) it is calculated for saturation over water. At temperatures below -23째C it is calculated for saturation over ice. Between -23째C and 0째C this parameter is calculated by interpolating between the ice and water values using a quadratic function.

## Band information

The product contains one single band named "RelH" expressed in m % at 1000hPa
