Name: Sentinel-5P L2
Description: |
 The Copernicus [Sentinel-5 Precursor mission](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-5p) dedicated to monitoring our atmosphere,
 consists of one satellite carrying the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument.  Sentinel-5 Precursor mission aims to fill in
 global atmospheric data gap between the retired ENVISAT and AURA missions and the future Sentinel -5 mission.The main objective of TROPOMI is 
 provide daily global observations of key atmospheric constituents related to air quality, ozone layer and climate change monitoring and forecasting. 
 Level 2 data provide total columns of ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, tropospheric columns of ozone, 
 vertical profiles of ozone and cloud & aerosol information. Level 2 data are available since April 2018.
 These measurements are used  for improving air quality forecasts as well as for monitoring the concentrations of atmospheric constituents.
