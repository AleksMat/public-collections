# ERA5-Land monthly averaged data 

## Short description

[The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)](https://www.ecmwf.int/) produces ERA5-Land dataset within the frame of 
 [Copernicus Climate Change Service](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/copernicus-services/climate-change).
 ERA5-Land  is a replay of the land component of the ERA5 climate reanalysis with a finer native resolution of 9km compared to 31km in ERA5 and an improved
 computational efficiency. The data in the [Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.1x0.1 degrees.
 ERA5-Land dataset describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period. 
 By combining model data and observations that goes back several decades in time, reanalysis provides an accurate description of the climate of the past.
 ERA5-Land monthly averaged data is a post-processed subset of the full ERA5-Land dataset representing pre-calculated monthly-mean averages
 to facilitate  quick and easy access when sub-monthly data is not required. 
 The temporal and spatial resolutions of ERA5-Land makes it very useful for land surface monitoring applications such as flood or drought forecasting.

| fal     | Forecast albedo                                       | dimensionless         | Is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. It is the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by Earth's surface, across the solar spectrum, for both direct and diffuse radiation. Values are between 0 and 1. Typically, snow and ice have high reflectivity with albedo values of 0.8 and above, land has intermediate values between about 0.1 and 0.4 and the ocean has low values of 0.1 or less. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The portion that is reflected by the Earth's surface depends on the albedo. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a climatological background albedo (observed values averaged over a period of several years) is used, modified by the model over water, ice and snow. Albedo is often shown as a percentage (%).                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| pe      | Potential evaporation                                 | m                     | Potential evaporation (pev) in the current ECMWF model is computed, by making a second call to the surface energy balance routine with the vegetation variables set to "crops/mixed farming" and assuming no stress from soil moisture. In other words, evaporation is computed for agricultural land as if it is well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by this artificial surface condition. The latter may not always be realistic. Although pev is meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give unrealistic results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced by dry air. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is simply called 'runoff'. This variable is the total amount of water accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units of runoff are depth in metres. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid square area. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood. More information about how runoff is calculated is given in the IFS Physical Processes documentation.                                                                                                                                                 |

The skin temperature is the theoretical temperature that is required to satisfy the surface energy balance.

Skin temperature is calculated differently over land and sea.

It consists of snow due to the large-scale atmospheric flow (horizontal scales greater than around a few hundred metres) and convection where smaller scale areas (around 5km to a few hundred kilometres) of warm air rise. If snow has melted during the period over which this variable was accumulated, then it will be higher than the snow depth. This variable is the total amount of water accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units given measure the depth the water would have if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box and model time step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (°C) by subtracting 273.15.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is simply called 'runoff'. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units of runoff are depth in metres. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid square area. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood. More information about how runoff is calculated is given in the IFS Physical Processes documentation.                                                                                                                                                                           |

The rest is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The difference between downward and reflected solar radiation is the surface net solar radiation. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m\-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m\-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds.

It is a measure of the weight of all the air in a column vertically above the area of the Earth's surface represented at a fixed point. Surface pressure is often used in combination with temperature to calculate air density. The strong variation of pressure with altitude makes it difficult to see the low and high pressure systems over mountainous areas, so mean sea level pressure, rather than surface pressure, is normally used for this purpose. The units of this variable are Pascals (Pa). Surface pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| sro     | Surface runoff                                        | m                     | Some water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is simply called 'runoff'. This variable is the total amount of water accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units of runoff are depth in metres. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid square area. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood. More information about how runoff is calculated is given in the IFS Physical Processes documentation.                                                                                                                                                 |
| sshf    | Surface sensible heat flux                            | J m\-2                | Transfer of heat between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere through the effects of turbulent air motion (but excluding any heat transfer resulting from condensation or evaporation). The magnitude of the sensible heat flux is governed by the difference in temperature between the surface and the overlying atmosphere, wind speed and the surface roughness. For example, cold air overlying a warm surface would produce a sensible heat flux from the land (or ocean) into the atmosphere. This is a single level variable and it is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m\-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m\-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ssrd    | Surface solar radiation downwards                     | J m-2                 | Amount of solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth. This variable comprises both direct and diffuse solar radiation. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface (represented by this variable). To a reasonably good approximation, this variable is the model equivalent of what would be measured by a pyranometer (an instrument used for measuring solar radiation) at the surface. However, care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box and model time step. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m\-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m\-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards. |
| strd    | Surface thermal radiation downwards                   | J m-2                 | Amount of thermal (also known as longwave or terrestrial) radiation emitted by the atmosphere and clouds that reaches the Earth's surface. The surface of the Earth emits thermal radiation, some of which is absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds. The atmosphere and clouds likewise emit thermal radiation in all directions, some of which reaches the surface (represented by this variable). This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m\-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m\-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| tsn     | Temperature of snow layer                             | K                     | This variable gives the temperature of the snow layer from the ground to the snow-air interface. The ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS) model represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (°C) by subtracting 273.15.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| tp      | Total precipitation                                   | m                     | Accumulated liquid and frozen water, including rain and snow, that falls to the Earth's surface. It is the sum of large-scale precipitation (that precipitation which is generated by large-scale weather patterns, such as troughs and cold fronts) and convective precipitation (generated by convection which occurs when air at lower levels in the atmosphere is warmer and less dense than the air above, so it rises). Precipitation variables do not include fog, dew or the precipitation that evaporates in the atmosphere before it lands at the surface of the Earth. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units of precipitation are depth in metres. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box and model time step.                                                                                                                                                                 |

The surface is at 0 cm. The volumetric soil water is associated with the soil texture (or classification), soil depth, and the underlying groundwater level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
