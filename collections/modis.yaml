Description: |
 [MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/) (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is the main
 instrument operating on both NASA's [Terra](https://terra.nasa.gov/) and [Aqua](https://aqua.nasa.gov/) satellites.
 It acquires images of the earth in 36 bands within the visible and the infrared regions of the spectrum at low to medium spatial resolutions. 
 MODIS is designed to provide atleast daily observations of land, oceans and lower atmosphere that contribute to
 local or global scale land or water applications. There are several products derived from MODIS which include land, atmosphere, cryospehere and ocean products.
 MCD43A4 Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) product Version 6 is a MODIS land product available in Sentinel Hub. 
 It is computed daily  for each of MODIS bands 1 - 7 and it contains the most representative pixels from 16 day period temporarily weighted to the ninth day.
 MCD43A4.006 is available since February 2000 on a daily basis but with a 8 days delay.
