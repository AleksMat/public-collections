**The goal of this registry is to expand access to useful data collections available on Euro Data Cube.** With that in mind, we prefer to list collections that are clearly documented, are actively supported, can be used for research or educational purposes. Collections are included at the discretion of the Euro Data Cube team, which may remove collections from the registry at any time. Data providers are responsible for maintaining and supporting the data that they share. 

## How are collections added to the registry?

Each collection in this repository is described in a dedicated YAML file in [/collections](https://github.com/eurodatacube/public-collections/tree/main/collections) directory, e.g. /collections/global-land-cover.yaml  
Data providers can create a new YAML file copying the structure of the most similar existing one. After committing it to the GitHub, create a pull request and Euro Data Cube team will review it and publish it in the Registry.  
Users are also welcome to revise existing collections, e.g. adding new usage examples , tools, etc.  

## How to make use of these collections

Please see the usage examples provided for each individual collection.
